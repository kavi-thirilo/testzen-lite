## Test Execution Issues

### Test File Not Found

**Error:** "Test file not found"

**Solution:**
- Verify file path is correct
- Use absolute or relative path from testzen-lite root
- File must have .xlsx extension

---

### App Not Found

**Error:** "No APK/IPA file found"

**Solution:**
- Place exactly ONE APK in `apps/android/` for Android tests
- Place exactly ONE IPA in `apps/ios/` for iOS tests
- Verify file has correct extension (.apk or .ipa)

---

### Element Not Found

**Error:** "Element not found" or "No such element"

**Solution:**
1. Verify locator is correct using Appium Inspector
2. Add wait time before action:
   ```
   Action: wait
   Test Data: 3
   ```
3. Use multi-locator fallback:
   ```
   Locator Type: id|accessibility_id|xpath
   Locator Value: button_id|ButtonLabel|//android.widget.Button
   ```
4. Check if element is in WebView (requires different locator strategy)

---

### App Crashes

**Solution:**
1. Check app logs:
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep your.app.package
   ```
2. Verify APK is compatible with device/emulator
3. Try debug APK instead of release APK
4. Check app permissions in test steps

---

## Appium Server Issues

### Port Already in Use

**Error:** "Port 4723 is already in use"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill existing Appium
pkill -f appium

# Or find and kill process manually
lsof -i :4723
kill -9 <PID>
```

---

### Appium Won't Start

**Solution:**
1. Check Appium log:
   ```bash
   cat /tmp/appium.log
   ```
2. Verify driver is installed:
   ```bash
   appium driver list --installed
   ```
3. Check Node.js version (needs 16+):
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

---

## Report Generation Issues

### No Reports Generated

**Solution:**
- Check `reports/html_reports/` folder
- Verify test completed successfully
- Check for file permission issues

---

### Screenshots Missing

**Solution:**
- Screenshots are disabled by default in some configurations
- Enable with: `./testzen run --file test.xlsx --screenshots yes`
- Check device screen is on and unlocked

---

## Performance Issues

### Slow Test Execution

**Solution:**
1. Reduce wait times in test steps
2. Use faster emulator (x86_64 images)
3. Enable hardware acceleration for emulator
4. Use physical device instead of emulator

---

### Emulator Boot Slow

**Solution:**
1. Allocate more RAM to emulator (in AVD settings)
2. Use x86_64 system image (faster than ARM)
3. Enable hardware acceleration (Intel HAXM or AMD)
4. Start emulator before running tests
